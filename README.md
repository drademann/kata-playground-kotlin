# kata-playground-kotlin
This is a project setup to quickly get started with various Coding Katas using Kotlin.

Currently the following Katas are included:

* Prime Factors (thanks to _Uncle Bob_ [Robert C. Martin's Prime Factor Kata] (http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.ThePrimeFactorsKata))
* String Calculator (thanks to [Roy Osherove](http://osherove.com/tdd-kata-1/)) 

A description with requirements for each Kata is included in each test class (see its JavaDoc).

Remember the TDD and Kata rules:
- Do one task at a time. 
- Do it incrementally. 
- Solve requirements as simple as possible.
- Refactor after each successful test.
- This is about learning TDD/BDD *"red, green, repeat"*
